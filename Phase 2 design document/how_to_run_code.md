Also note that major is optional, and you can leave it empty for now. 

- In the same window, notice that there are also 2 buttons at the bottom called "register" and "login". After filling the required information, click register, since your information is never store in our program.


- After a successful registration with correct information, you can click on login. You will be assigned a random id from 1 to 10. An user id of 0 corresponds to the employer. The employer has many more authorities than a regular user, such as register account for an Intern, send wage to employees money, and more.


- Then, you will be prompted to the next window. There are five buttons which are Salary, JobPositions, Schedule, Intern and Exist. Click on any of those to explore further.

- When you log in to the Salary, there are userid 1 and userid 2 and also the salary, only when you put 0 into the userid 1 that means you are the employer thus you have the authority to give the userid 2 salary.


After that, you can click back to come back to the user information surface, if you click to on the JobPosition, you can see there is Userid, UserMajor, type your userid and UserMajor, then you can be referenced base on what your major is, like if you type computer science(remember to type " " in it), base on the major, you would get a reference as IT department and we only have a few major that can be referenced so far.

Then, If you click on the schedule, you can see there are Userid and Changehour that shows to you, according to your userid and change hours, you can see how many hours you work for the entire week. The basic working hour for a week is 40 hours and your actual working hour is the basic hour add the change hour which the change hour can either be positive or negative.


Next, for the intern, there are userid, password, username, Email, Major, Grade, Standard and also Intern button in this window. This window is only available for employer to make modifications, like if you type your userid as 0 then you have the authority to set up an information for your employees. You can give the intern a password, a username, an email, a major which all based on their own information that they told you, a grade based on his/her behavior and also the standard that you set up for them. Besides, after you register these information for them you can click Intern which will pop up an information says successful. Then, the intern will get a random id from 11 to 20.

Final, the above description are all our functions that you can use to see our program and after your try, you can click  Exist button to close the window smoothly.
