As a group, answer the following questions:

- For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:

    (a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or

    (b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.
1. Principle 1: Equitable Use

   Base on Principle 1( Equitable Use), Our design is useful and marketable to people with the need to hr system. It provides the same means of use for all users:(employer, employee, intern) identical whenever possible; equivalent when not. It avoids segregating or stigmatizing any users because in login UI every user has its own password and account. It provides the provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users. The text field for the password is secured, others can not see what you entered. It makes the design appealing to all users.


2. Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

   Base on Principle 2( Flexibility in Use), our design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. It provides choices in methods of use, so you can either use windows or ios systems. It accommodates right- or left-handed access and uses because people use our system in a computer, so right- or left-handed access are both available. It facilitates the user's accuracy and precision. It provides adaptability to the user's pace since it is used on the most updated and common device.


3. Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

   Base on Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use, the use of our system is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level. It eliminates unnecessary complexity since the contexts are easy to understand, easy to register and use the functionalities. It is consistent with user expectations and intuition because it follows the common procedure of a login system now. It accommodates a wide range of literacy and language skills because simple words like login, register, intern etc are easy to understand. It arranges information consistent with its importance since we always try to keep the text simple. It provides effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion, after task completion, the system will tell you if the task is complete or not.


4. Principle 4: Perceptible Information

   Base on Principle 4( Perceptible Information), our design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities. It uses different modes (verbal) for the redundant presentation of essential information, but we are not able to make it tactile, we will try to add more images in the future. It provides adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings. It maximizes the "legibility" of essential information. It differentiates elements in ways that can be described: we categorize functionalities into different parts like scheduling, salary etc, they are all easy to understand. However, It does not provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by people with sensory limitations since it can only be used through the computer, in the future, we want our system to be used on any device.


5. Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

   Base on Principle 5( Tolerance for Error), our design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. It arranges elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements, most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded. It provides warnings of hazards and errors, for example, if the user enters the wrong form email or sets an empty password, the system will not accept it. It provides fail-safe features since we add a “back” button just in case something wrong we can always go back to the last page we viewed. It discourages unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance.


6. Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

   Base on Principle 6( Low Physical Effort), our system can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue. It allows the user to maintain a neutral body position. It uses reasonable operating forces and minimizes repetitive actions. It minimizes sustained physical effort. Since people will be using our system through the computer, so I assume our system fits all these requirements.


7. Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

   Base on Principle 7( Size and Space for Approach and Use), our design has appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility. It provides a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user since our system buttons and instructions are very simple and easy to understand. So it makes reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user. But it does not accommodate variations in hand and grip size, maybe if we are able to make the system work on the phone as well in the future, we can make the size expectation happen.  And at that time it will provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance.


- Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

  - In the United States, only 38% of all employees work for companies with more than 1,000 employees, and only 22% work for companies with more than 10,000 employees. So instead of focusing our software sales and product strategy toward the biggest companies, we are planning to target a less saturated market quickly: the mid-market. There is a large number of relatively small companies in the mid-market that only require the basic functions of the hr system because of the limited working capital. We are aiming this kind of company because firstly we are aware that our hr system, for now, is not qualified to sell to some big company. So these small companies are our best choice. On the other hand, if we can find a way to tap into the small business market, the profit is still considerable. For example, Paychex dominates the market for small business payroll and still is very large, profitable, and growing.


- Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.

  - We think our human resource system is less likely to be used by tiny companies that do not have enough employees. As we all know, our system can store a large number of “user” and their personal data, so that the system can help the manager(employer) easily search and access employees’ data without taking much effort to go through all the paperwork. However, for the tiny companies that only have a few employees, it is much easier to just go through the paperwork to know employees’ information instead of using our system. So these kinds of companies with a small number of employees are less likely to use our human resource system.
