## Task 2 â€” Writing the specification

Once your group has decided on a domain, your first task is to develop a specification for the system you will be designing. We have provided a minimal list of requirements below to help ensure your specification is sufficiently rich to get started. We are looking for something of similar scale to the JShell case study specification from the Week 2 slides. There should be enough complexity that all of your group members have substantial work to do. Everyone should design and write code throughout the project! The following requirements are in terms of the layers of Clean Architecture, which are covered in Week 3.

- [x] at least three entity classes
- [x] at least two use case classes
- [x] at least one controller
- [x] at least a basic command line interface
