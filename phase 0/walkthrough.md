## Task 4 â€” Scenario Walk-Through

Provide a written explanation (no more than 1-2 paragraphs) of a typical scenario walk-through for your CRC model. Try to choose a scenario that will really demonstrate to your TA that your model is doing a good job satisfying your specification! This will also help you better visualize how your program might look like once you start coding.
